finger.js
a simple to use JS Synth
==================================

this is not a final thing.
inspired by figure (ios app) and a presentation of cloudtracker 2.0 by halfbyte
i wanted to create a little JS sound experiment
target: creating a simple to use sound app like the figure-app by propellerheads

so i started and programmed this little tool in a short night.
after some webkit sound/webaudio research, i found this nice JS synth lib on github:
	https://github.com/colinbdclark/Flocking

so this is the first try.
